"The only way to do great work is to love what you do." – Steve Jobs

Food I don’t like: I don’t like olives – I find them too bitter.

Recommendation: I recommend watching "Dark," a German sci-fi TV series. It’s suspenseful, intriguing, and has a brilliant plot that will keep you hooked.

German word: "Gemütlichkeit" – it describes a feeling of coziness, warmth, and good company, and I think it’s a beautiful concept to know!
